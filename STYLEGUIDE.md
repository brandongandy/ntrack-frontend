# Project nTrack Style Guide
## version 0.1

### Colors
The Primary Color is Material "green darken-1"

The Secondary Color is Material "blue-grey darken-2"

"OK" and similar style buttons should always be colored Primary

"Cancel" and similar style buttons should always be colored Secondary

### Buttons
On small forms, such as modals or dialogs, the OK/Submit button should always be on the lower right.
If there is a Close/Cancel button, it will be placed to the left of the OK button on these forms.
So they will look like: [ Cancel | Submit ]
